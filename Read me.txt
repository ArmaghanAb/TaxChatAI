# Tax Chat UI

This project provides a simple chat interface for querying tax-related questions and getting responses from a backend API. The program uses Node.js with Express and Axios.

## Prerequisites

3. Install necessary dependencies (run this only the first time):

```bash
npm install

4. Start the server by running:

node server.js

You should see the following message indicating that the server is running successfully:

## Database Setup

    #Dependency: mysql2: MySQL client for Node.js, used to connect to the MySQL database.

The project stores user prompts and responses in a MySQL database. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. Open MySQL Workbench.
2. Create a new database schema named `auditdb`.
3. Run the following SQL query to create the necessary table:

```sql:

CREATE TABLE PromptsAndResponses (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
    response TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

SELECT * FROM PromptsAndResponses;
